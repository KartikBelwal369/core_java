//QUESTION 1:
//ANSWER 1:

public class Test {

    public static void main(){
        Test obj=new Test();
        obj.hobby();
    }
    void hobby(){
        String name="Kartik Belwal";
                int age=19;
                System.out.println("Name="+name);
                System.out.println("Age="+age);
    }
}



//QUESTION 2:
//ANSWER 2:

/* 1 : Class name:
    Test
    Fun

2 : Function name:
    test
    Fun()

3 : Variable:
    numPlay
    var

4 : Static variable:
    NUM
    PLAY_GAME
*/


/*QUESTION 3:
  ANSWER 3:


1. .java file : Every code written by a programmer is compressed in this file. And hence after its compilation the main
                file runs.
    .class file : This is the compiled version of file which can be executed.

2. Java is not completely oop`s language because java contains many primitive datatypes  which are (int char double bool)
   which are not object and hence there are wrapper classes so java cannot be a pure object oriented class.

3: EXAMPLE IF NR-WA :
        void test(int a,int b){
        System.out.println("MyName");
        }

/*QUESTION 5:
  ANSWER 5:


  Wrapper classes : These are the clases that are used to convert primitive datatypes (int , char , fload , bool , etc)
                    into corresponding objects.
                    Java Wrapper Class :

                    Primitive type                           Wrapper class
                    int                                      Integer
                    bool                                     Bool
                    char                                     Character
                    double                                   Double
