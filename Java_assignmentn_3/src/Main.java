//Question 1 :
//Answer 1 :

/* Encapsulation : Encapsulation is a key function of Object oriented programming.hence it refers to the bundling
                   of fields and method inside single a class.In this we don't provide direct access to the user
                   we only provide a private id by which user cannot change the main content of the given id.



class Person {
private int age;   //private age.
public int getAge () {   //getting method
return age;
}
public void setAge(int age){
this.age = age;
}
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person p1 = new Person();
    p1.setAge(19);
    System.out.println("My age is " = + p1.getAge());
    }
}



Question 2 :
Answer 2 :
Polymorphism : It is the technique by which we create methods() which work different for different class.
Example :

//Question 3 :
//Answer 3 :
/* 1 : Access specifiers : The access specifiers provides accessiblity to class and methods they are also known as acess
                           modifiers.There are four types of access specifiers :

                           a : public
                           b : default
                           c : private
                           d : protected


 2: Packages : Packages are used to store the files that we have created in our program.
                  So if we are creating a package of package com.company then here this package defines that
                  the classes which we are making into our program that recides in a package names as package com.
                  company.*/
                  /*Example :
                          package com.company;
                  import java.util.Scanner;
                  public class Main {
                  public static void main (string args[]){
                  System.out.println("Taking input from the user");
                  Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
                  System.out.println("Marks in maths");
                  int maths = sc.nextInt();
                  System.out.println("Marks in physics");
                  int physics = sc.nextInt();
                  System.out.println("Marks in hindi");
                  int hindi = sc.nextOInt();
                  int percentage = (maths + physics + hindi)*100/300;
                  System.out.println(percentage);

                  }

                  }



3 : Final keyword : The final keyword is a keyword which is non accessible by the user
                    It restricts the user to make any change in class and method.
